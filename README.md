# DevSalone Slack Coding Assessment


# Introduction

Share a project you've worked on recently (or in the past) What do you think of the challenge and what it means to you ?

Follow the instructions below to answer questionnaire. Next, the following five questions will be used to ensure our hackers have the foundation necessary for the hackathon. Please create a free github (https://github.com/join) account if you don't already have one, publish your code that solves each of these to https://gist.github.com and share link in your post.

To submit your answer, please send a email (ernest@kamara.io/pdtpatrick@gmail.com). Once your answer is approved, you will receive an invite to join another group. 

**1. FIND THE LONGEST WORD**

**2. RETURN ALL ODDS**

```[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]```   

**3. SORT DICTIONARY/MAP BASED ON KEY**

```{"key": "value", "ab": "hi there", "we": "say what"}``` 

**4. READING A FILE**

``` hi,bye,there,3```
