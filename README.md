Share a project you've worked on recently (or in the past) What do you think of the challenge and what it means to you ?

Follow the instructions below to answer questionnaire. Next, the following five questions will be used to ensure our hackers have the foundation necessary for the hackathon. Please create a free github (https://github.com/join) account, publish your code that solves each of these to https://gist.github.com and share link in your post. In order to scale this, weâ€™ll accept the first 20 answers based on the time of submission.

To submit your answer, please send a message (via messenger) to one of the admins. Once your answer is approved, you will receive an invite to join another group. In this new group, you'll receive materials so help set up your dev environment and also form teams.
